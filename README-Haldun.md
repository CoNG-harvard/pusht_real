when the t block is occluded sometimes we get wrong angle, for this case use temporality
Angle matching coarse to fine
write as class functions and return better results

Work on depth information
    - How to get location in 3D space?
    - If the center point is occluded what can I do?


New ideas:
    Homography
    Write pipeline and then use
        - Line based
    Finally ML based...
